the results of the ct are suspicios for lung cancer 
many times biopsy does not yield a definite answer 
3 weeks is 
a long time one should know by now if there were tumor cells 
the doctor who sent for the biosy should soon decide - if it is a negative biopsy 
should he send for antoher biopsy - as we do in many suspicious cases or  
just do a follow up since the lesion is not that suspicipus 
hopefully its nothing
