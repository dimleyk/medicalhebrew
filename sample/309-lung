dory for the english computer problem 
in israel in sal habriut right now there is only chemotherapy for metastatic lung cancer 
but also if there are bone metastasis one can give a drug known as aredia 
which is against bone metastasis 
thereis an opitn of non chemotherapy treatement 
but it is not in sal habriut 
it is very important that yiur father will meet an oncologist  to discuss all 
possible therapies 
people survive much longer now with metastatic lung cancer 
and in many cases in a good quality of life 
so its very important to meet an oncologist
