in this condition and this age usually we do not give chemo 
good chances it will destroy more than help 
still good supportive care is imporatant 
several things can be done 
1)he must have oxygen at home from at least a mecholel chamtzan 
2( one can try inhalation   also with dexamethasone 
3 good pain control 
4 perhaps he needs clexan - noged krisha  bezrika  if he does not move at all 
but that depnds at his condition 
the best thing is to have a visit from hospice bait /ishpuz bait to help yoiu with everything 
sory about the english right now i dont have acomputer with hebrew
